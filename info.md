# Features from user's perspective
User can log in to Dashboard. There will be different account for different types of users to control who can do what.

**Transaction**. User can see list of transaction that we are interested in. As new transactions appear in blockchain, view will display Transaction in near real-time. User can view transaction related to some NFT, Contract, or get latest 10 of any. In later phases, aggregate information will be available.

**NFT**. User can see list of issued NFTs, their status and their owner. NFTs can be placed on marketplace from admin panel.

**Contract**. View showing our NFT contracts we setup for the Dashboard. Later can deactivate some contracts (as it will depreceate). Setting up new contract will launch task to synchronise Dashboard with Blockchain data.

**NFT Mint History**. View where user can mint an NFTs or setup planned minting for some time(after 1h or 12 June 12:00). User also can check all previous minting attemps both successful and not.

**Transfer**. Admin user can transfer NFT that belongs to marketplace account manually to another address, for example, as a prize for hackathon or gift.

User also can change his password.

# Tech stuff

DB PostgreSQL

Scylla, Cassandra

Can use Redis for Task queues, but need to use RDB also, to make data more persistent.

## Python

FastAPI or Flask or Django + DRF

Celery is default for task queues in Python.
Alternatives:
* dramtiq
* RQ
* Huey
* Taskmaster
others: [here](https://www.fullstackpython.com/task-queues.html)

## Go
For workers:
* taskq
* asynq <-
* goworker
* [machinery](https://github.com/RichardKnop/machinery/tree/final-v1#defaultqueue)
* gocelery
* que-go
* cherami - but deprecated by Uber. They use Kafka now. 

## JS
Node.
Task queue:
* bull
* celery.node

# Authorization
Roles:
* **superadmin** - can change user role(admin)
* **admin** - can create user(minter or observer), add/delete contract.
* **minter** - can mint nft's and manual transfer.
* **observer** - can view data.

Role hierarchy for now: higher role user have all permissions from lower level + additional

Permissions:
* view data - observer
* mint nft - minter
* transfer nft - minter
* change status of nft(on marketplace) - minter
* delete/add contract from contracts list - admin
* create minter/observer - admin
* delete and launch scan Transactions - superadmin
* create admin - superadmin
* reset password for user - superadmin

User pipleline:
1. Superadmin generated by CLI or manually
2. Superadmin can create admins or other users from dashboard interface.
3. When user created activation link is generated.
4. New user goes to link and sets a password.
5. User can change his/her own password.

More permissions and roles can be added later. Roles does not necessarily have to be strictly hierarchical. In future, "sibbling" roles could be added.

# AI/Analytics research

Transaction is a lot of data. 
* Can use transaction data for trading (by observing demand for certain products).
* Number of Receiving vs Sending addresses in transfer to check concentration.
* Association analysis and Market Basket data within small time interval. To see what kind of products(loyalty points) bought together.
* Repeated vs Non-repeated purchases.
* Monitor data to reflect operational activity -> performance issues. Like transaction amount dropping significantly.
* In case NFTs can use machine learning to predict or identify NFTs that people like.
* Keepping balance and checking for "unaccounted" tokens, NFTs to identify fraud.
* Customer profiling.
* Sales forecasting.

# NFT marketplaces
### OpenSea
Each person can create his own NFT and manage them. Very simple and easy UI/UX. Ethereum, Polygon, Kytn, Solana chains. This is for regular people - Marketplace. Do not have analytics.

Other NFT marketplace is same just allows to create and sell your own NFT, no analytics because they are not targeted at Business. Doesn't track transactions.
